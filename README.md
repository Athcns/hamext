> Started Creation on November 12, 2021

**Hamext** is based on the famous ShakeSpeare play, *Hamlet*. The story was shortened into a web based text RPG. This was created for an assignment in Eng 12 where we were required to show our learning of the story through a piece of creative work. In my case, I wanted to take a try at creating a text based RPG game like people did many years ago.
